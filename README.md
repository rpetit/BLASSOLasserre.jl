# Solving the BLASSO using Lasserre hierarchies

![dual_certif](dual_certif.png)

This repository allows to solve the Beurling LASSO with polynomial measurements
using Lasserre hierarchies such as decribed in [1]. The `example.ipynb` notebook allows to reproduce the experiments presented in this paper.

## Installation instructions

Enter `add https://github.com/rpetit/BLASSOLasserre.jl` in the Pkg REPL
